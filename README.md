# learnmarkov.tech

A Vue.js project that attempts to visually describe how Markov Chains work, in the form of a business name generator. It utilises almost 2,000 business names from the [ASIC Company Dataset](https://data.gov.au/dataset/asic-companies) in doing so.

This project was created as a part of GovHack 2017, and won the Code for the Classroom award. [Here's the submission page and video.](https://2017.hackerspace.govhack.org/project/learnmarkovtech)

Our team, The Three Markovs, was comprised of:

- [Christian Kiely](https://github.com/ckiely91)
- [Daniel Bergamin](https://github.com/danielbergamin)
- [Bilal Akil](https://github.com/bilalakil)

We're no longer paying for the learnmarkov.tech domain, but you can still view the website at [learnmarkov.netlify.app](https://learnmarkov.netlify.app) - cheers to Netlify for free open source hosting!
